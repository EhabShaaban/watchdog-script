# watchdog script
I have a cluttered downloads folder. Too lazy to clean it.
But when I'm in my german course I need to take multiple screenshots.
This watchdog script move these photos to new folder created in Desktop.

#### TODO
Write follow-up script to upload this folder to my google cloud drive.
